I have been pondering *how* to solve this problem
since 2008 ... and today it dawned on me that there's
an *obvious* solution that has been *right* in front of us
for quite some time ... #ItsSoSimple

Its going to take a couple of days to write the code
however I don't have *time* right now because
we have a *client* deadline for Monday so my weekend
is spoken for...
So I'm simply sharing this mental note on GitHub
so I can come back to it *after* I've knocked the
client project features out the park!

The only clue I *can* give is that it
will work with env2 https://github.com/dwyl/env2
and will probably get to the top of Hacker News
when we release V3 ...

I'm pretty excited... You will be too... :wink:
